Bello! I am SheepChef, a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ Chinese junior high school student.<br>
I am currently working on JavaScipt-based and Python-based projects.<br>
Never accept any kinds of Contact, I am working on my own for now.<br>
As for my hobbies... They're learning Japanese, coding, playing the electronic keyboard and appreciating comics.<br>
I am just a common student in a busy but prosperous city, competing with over 20000 other students just for being able to study in senior high school.<br>
Because of this, my Github projects will be inactive for a long time.<br>
All in all, hope you could have a successful life.<br>
